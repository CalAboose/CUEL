1. Overview
=====================

CUEL is a stack-based concatenative programming language.
A program written in it consists of function definitions, only.
Every function definition represents a sequence of function calls.
It has built-in functions for arithmetic operations, branching,
stack manipulation and basic I/O work. Functions take their arguments
from the data stack and push the result back to the stack. Recursion is
utilized for repetitive tasks.


2. Programmer's Manual
=====================

A CUEL program compiles to bytecode which is then executed by a virtual
machine. The whole program consists of a single source code file.
CUEL has a rather strict syntax. The EBNF can be found in Appendix A.


2.1. Compilation
---------------------

The compiler is written in Python and is named 'cuelc'.
Compilation takes as input a CUEL source file and produces a file
containing the program's executable bytecode.
The source files' file extension is 'cuel'.
For compilation the following is typed in a console:

$ python cuelc.py FILE

Where FILE is the path to the program's source code.


2.2. Execution
---------------------

The virtual machine is written in Python and is named 'cuelvm'.
It executes files containing CUEL bytecode.
Bytecode files' file extension is 'cuby'.
To run a program requires the following to be typed in a console:

$ python cuelvm.py FILE

Where FILE is the path to the program's bytecode.


2.3. Program structure
---------------------

A CUEL source file contains a sequence of function definitions
separated by a blank line. Every definition starts with the function's name
immediately followed by a colon and a new line. The function's body follows
after the function's name and consists of consecutive lines of function calls.
Every line represents exactly one function call. The first function definition
is always that of the main function. It is called 'MAIN' and program execution
starts from it. Command-line arguments are not supported.


2.4. Program operation
---------------------

Every program statement occupies a separate line and is a call to a built-in
function or a user defined function in the program's source file.
Program execution requires the use of two stacks - call stack and data stack.
The call stack stores the user defined functions' return address on invocation.
The data stack stores the program's data. Function calls pop their arguments
from the data stack and push the result back to it. The data stack is cyclic
which allows access to every value on the stack, not just the top.


2.5. Built-in functions
---------------------

All arithmetic operations work with integer values.

TOP refers to the top of the data stack.
TOP-1 refers to the value immediately below TOP.
TOP-2 refers to the value immediately below TOP-1.
BOTTOM refers to the bottom of the data stack.

cal <FUNC-NAME> - calls the user defined function named <FUNC-NAME>.
caz <FUNC-NAME> - calls the user defined function named <FUNC-NAME>
		  if TOP is zero.
cnz <FUNC-NAME> - calls the user defined function named <FUNC-NAME>
		  if TOP is not zero.
cgz <FUNC-NAME> - calls the user defined function named <FUNC-NAME>
		  if TOP is greater than zero.
clz <FUNC-NAME> - calls the user defined function named <FUNC-NAME>
		  if TOP is less than zero.

swp - swaps TOP and TOP-1.
swx - swaps TOP and TOP-2.
rcw - rotate data stack clockwise. Effectively pops TOP and makes
      it the new BOTTOM.
rcc - rotate data stack counterclockwise. Effectively pops BOTTOM
      and makes it the new TOP.

pop - pops TOP.
dup - duplicates TOP.

neg - negates TOP.
+   - sums TOP-1 with TOP.
*   - multiplies TOP-1 by TOP.
/   - divides TOP-1 by TOP.
-   - subtracts TOP from TOP-1.
%   - modulo TOP-1 by TOP.

getn - reads a number from standard input and pushes it on the data stack.
putn - pops TOP and writes it to the standard output.
puts - pops a string off the data stack and writes it to standard output.

<number> - pushes a positive integer with value <number> on the data stack.
<string> - pushes a zero terminated sequence of positive integer values
           on the data stack. The values represent ASCII characters.


2.6. Example program
---------------------

A program for computing the factorial of a number entered by the user:

MAIN:
        "Enter number: "
        puts
        1
        getn
        dup
        cgz FACT
        pop
        putn

FACT:
        dup
        swx
        *
        swp
        1
        -
        dup
        cgz FACT



3. Developer's Manual
=====================


3.1. Instruction set
---------------------

The program's source code compiles to virtual machine instructions.
Every built-in function has a corresponding machine instruction.
There's an additional instruction called 'ret' that returns from
a function call. It is inserted in the bytecode after every function's body
automatically by the compiler. Numbers are instructions as well. Every number
represents a unique instruction. Strings are inserted in the bytecode
as zero terminated sequence of numbers.


3.2. Bytecode file format
---------------------

Every machine instruction is encoded as a 32-bit signed value. The whole
bytecode file is a sequence of 32-bit instructions. The only exception is
the first value which is the magic number - 0x4C455543.
For the actual encoding of the instruction set refer to the source code.


3.3. Program execution
---------------------

Upon execution the VM loads the bytecode in memory and begins executing
the instruction sequence starting from index 1 - the first instruction
of the MAIN function. Execution continues until MAIN returns (via the 'ret'
instruction). When a user defined function is called the current value
of the instruction pointer is pushed onto the call stack.

Every function consists of a sequence of instructions and the last one
is always 'ret'. When it is executed the function's return address is popped
from the call stack and assigned to the instruction pointer. The function
returns and execution continues in the caller.

Numbers are encoded as their 32-bit value. Only positive numbers can be encoded
in the bytecode since negative values represent the built-in functions.
Thus number values are constrained in the range of [0..2^31). If an error occurs
during execution the program terminates.
